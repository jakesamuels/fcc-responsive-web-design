      <h2>What is Set Theory?</h2>

      <p>
        Set theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of
        sets, which are collections of objects. These objects, called elements
        or members, can be anything: numbers, letters, or even other sets. Set
        theory provides the foundation for many areas of mathematics, including
        algebra, topology, and logic.

      <h3>Basic Concepts of Set Theory</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Definition of a Set
          <p>
            A set is simply a well-defined collection of distinct objects. Sets
            are usually denoted by capital letters, and their elements are
            listed inside curly brackets {}.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Example:</dt>
            <dd>A = {1,2,3,4,5}</dd>
            <dd>B = {a,b,c,d}</dd>
          </dl>
        </li>

        <li>
          Ways to Represent Sets
          <dl>
            <dt>There are three common ways to represent a set:</dt>
            <dd>
              <strong>Roster Form:</strong> Listing out all elements explicitly.
              Example: A = {2,4,6,8}.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              <strong>Set-Builder Notation:</strong> Describing the properties
              of elements. Example: A = {x ‚à£ x is an even number less than 10}.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              <strong>Venn Diagrams:</strong> A graphical representation using
              circles to show relationships between sets.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </li>

        <li>
          Types of Sets
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Empty Set (‚àÖ or {}):</strong> A set with no elements.
              Example: The set of prime numbers divisible by 10.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finite and Infinite Sets:</strong> A set with a countable
              number of elements is finite; otherwise, it‚Äôs infinite. Example:
              The set of natural numbers (ùëÅ) is infinite.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Subset (‚äÜ):</strong> A set A is a subset of B if all
              elements of A are in B.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Universal Set (U):</strong> The set containing all
              elements under consideration.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Set Operations
          <p>Set theory involves several operations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Union (A ‚à™ B):</strong> The set of all elements in either
              A or B or both.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Intersection (A ‚à© B):</strong> The set of elements common
              to both A and B.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Difference (A - B):</strong> The set of elements in A but
              not in B.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Complement (A<sup>c</sup>):</strong> The set of all
              elements not in A.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Why is Set Theory Important?</h4>
        <p>
          Set theory is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and has a
          profound impact on various fields, such as computer science, logic,
          and data structures. It provides the foundation for understanding
          mathematical relations, defining functions, and proving theorems. By
          organizing mathematical objects into sets, set theory allows for the
          study of their relationships, which are essential in fields like
          algebra, topology, and combinatorics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In computer science, set theory helps in the development of
          algorithms, database management, and artificial intelligence. In
          logic, set theory serves as a framework for formal reasoning and
          proofs. Additionally, the concepts of set theory are used to
          understand and manipulate data in programming languages, which rely
          heavily on the notion of collections, such as arrays, lists, and sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set theory also provides a structured way to approach problems in
          other areas, such as probability theory, where sets are used to
          represent events, and in statistics, where data is often grouped into
          sets for analysis. In essence, set theory is not just a mathematical
          abstraction but a vital tool in solving real-world problems across
          various domains.
