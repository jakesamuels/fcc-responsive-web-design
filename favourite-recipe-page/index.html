          <li>
            1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns <br />
            (use normal peppercorns if you can't find these)
          </li>
          <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
          <li>1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder</li>
          <li>1 tsp sesame seeds</li>
          <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
          <li>
            250g Asian greens <br />
            (such as pak choi)
          </li>
          <li>
            handful chopped coriander <br />

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol class="method-list">
          <li>
            Cut the chicken thighs into strips. Crush the salt with the
            peppercorns in a pestle and mortar, then mix with the cornflour and
            five-spice and tip into a sandwich bag. Tip the chicken into the bag
            and shake well to coat in the flour mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Toss the sesame seeds in a pan over a medium heat and lightly toast,
            for around a minute, then add the olive oil. Add the chicken and
            cook for 7-8 mins until golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix the soy and honey and tip into the pan along with the Asian
            greens, cook for 2-3 mins further until everything is well coated
            and the greens are cooked through. Serve topped with coriander and
            sliced spring onions alongside some cooked rice.
          </li>
