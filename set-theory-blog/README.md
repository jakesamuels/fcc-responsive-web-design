## 📖 What is Set Theory?

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that studies **sets**, which are collections of objects. These objects, called **elements** or **members**, can be numbers, symbols, or even other sets. Set theory forms the foundation for many mathematical disciplines, including **algebra, topology, and logic**.

## 🏗 Basic Concepts of Set Theory

### 🔹 Definition of a Set

A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, typically denoted by **capital letters**, with elements enclosed in **curly brackets `{}`**.

**Example:**

- \( A = \{1,2,3,4,5\} \)
- \( B = \{a,b,c,d\} \)

### 📌 Ways to Represent Sets

There are **three common ways** to represent a set:

1. **Roster Form:** Listing all elements explicitly.
   - **Example:** \( A = \{2,4,6,8\} \)
2. **Set-Builder Notation:** Defining elements using a property.
   - **Example:** \( A = \{ x \mid x \text{ is an even number less than 10} \} \)
3. **Venn Diagrams:** Using circles to show relationships between sets.

### 🔢 Types of Sets

- **Empty Set (∅ or `{}`):** A set with no elements.
  - **Example:** The set of prime numbers divisible by 10.
- **Finite & Infinite Sets:**
  - A set with a countable number of elements is **finite**; otherwise, it’s **infinite**.
  - **Example:** The set of natural numbers (\(\mathbb{N}\)) is infinite.
- **Subset (⊆):** A set \( A \) is a **subset** of \( B \) if all elements of \( A \) are in \( B \).
- **Universal Set (U):** The set containing **all elements** under consideration.

### ✂ Set Operations

Set theory involves **four main operations**:

- **Union (A ∪ B):** All elements in \( A \) or \( B \) or both.
- **Intersection (A ∩ B):** Common elements between \( A \) and \( B \).
- **Difference (A - B):** Elements in \( A \) but not in \( B \).
- **Complement (Aᶜ):** Elements not in \( A \).

## 🎯 Why is Set Theory Important?

Set theory is fundamental to various fields, including:

- **Mathematics:** Forms the basis of algebra, topology, and combinatorics.
- **Computer Science:** Used in database management, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.
- **Logic & Proofs:** Helps in formal reasoning and theorem proving.
- **Data Science:** Utilized for grouping and categorizing data in statistics and probability.
